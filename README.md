# Tac-Tic-Toe-Game-with-time

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game with an added challenge of a timer to make gameplay more dynamic and engaging. Each player is allotted 5 seconds to make their move. If a player fails to play within the given time, they lose their turn, and their opponent gets to play two consecutive moves as a penalty. This ensures the game remains fast-paced and adds a strategic layer to decision-making under pressure.

The timer functionality is implemented using threads, allowing the game to handle timing independently without interrupting other processes. The thread tracks the countdown for each player's turn and triggers the logic to skip a turn if the time runs out. This threading approach ensures smooth execution and real-time responsiveness, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
